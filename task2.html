<p>
    Valorant is an FPS(first person Shooter) game that is basically same game logic as its rival game that is CSgo. 
    It is similar in terms of the type but not so similar in terms of game experience. 
    Valorant is like a better version of Csgo interms of the abilities of character or the overall graphics.
    Players play as one of a set of Agents, characters based on several countries and cultures around the world.
    In the main game mode, players are assigned to either the attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it.
     Agents have unique abilities, each requiring charges, as well as a unique ultimate ability that requires charging through kills, deaths, orbs, or objectives.
